# Smart Threat Detection & Alert System  
## Kiro HERO Documentation – HackXios 2025

This folder contains the complete HERO documentation created using the **Kiro platform** for the Smart Threat Detection & Alert System developed during HackXios 2025.

Kiro was used as a planning-first framework to structure the problem, define architecture, guide implementation, and document learnings. This folder demonstrates how thoughtful planning and clear documentation shaped the final system.

## Project Overview

Public and semi-public spaces such as campuses, metro stations, malls, and event venues face increasing security threats. Traditional surveillance systems rely heavily on manual monitoring, which is slow, error-prone, and reactive.

Our solution introduces an **AI-powered, real-time threat detection system** that analyzes live camera feeds to identify suspicious objects and weapons, classify threat levels, and alert authorities instantly—while remaining ethical and privacy-conscious.

## Why Kiro?

Kiro emphasizes clarity before code. Using Kiro helped us:
- Break down a complex problem into manageable modules
- Plan architecture before implementation
- Maintain alignment between idea, execution, and documentation
- Capture decision-making throughout the hackathon
