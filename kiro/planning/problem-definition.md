# Problem Definition

Public and semi-public spaces are increasingly vulnerable to security threats such as unattended bags, concealed weapons, and suspicious behavior. Locations like transportation hubs, educational campuses, shopping centers, and event venues depend largely on manual surveillance systems.

Traditional surveillance faces major limitations:
- Continuous monitoring is human-intensive
- Delayed response times
- High probability of missed or misjudged threats
- Ineffective detection of unattended or concealed objects

These challenges create a need for an **intelligent, proactive system** that can continuously monitor environments, detect potential threats in real time, and alert authorities quickly—without violating privacy or causing panic.

The goal is not confrontation, but **early detection and informed response**.
