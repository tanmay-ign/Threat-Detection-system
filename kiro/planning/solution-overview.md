# Solution Overview

The Smart Threat Detection & Alert System is an AI-driven surveillance solution designed to enhance public safety through early detection and intelligent analysis.

The system continuously processes live camera feeds to:
- Detect objects using AI models
- Track object movement over time
- Analyze threat levels based on object type and behavior
- Trigger real-time alerts for critical detections

The solution prioritizes:
- Non-intrusive monitoring
- Ethical AI usage
- Fast and accurate threat identification
- Scalable deployment across large spaces

Rather than replacing human decision-making, the system assists authorities with timely, data-driven insights.
