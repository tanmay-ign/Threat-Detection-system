# Threat Classification

Detected objects are categorized into three classes:
- Safe (e.g., people, regular objects)
- Suspicious (e.g., unattended bags)
- Weapon (e.g., guns, knives)

Threat levels:
- SAFE
- MEDIUM
- HIGH
- CRITICAL

Weapon detections automatically trigger critical alerts, while suspicious objects are monitored for persistence and behavior changes.
